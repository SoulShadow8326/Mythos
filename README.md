# Mythos â€” AI-Powered Storytelling in an Enchanted Book

**Mythos** is an immersive, AI-powered storytelling platform designed to transform the act of writing with AI into a magical, collaborative experience. Rather than serving as a mere utility, Mythos invites writers, students, and creative minds into an interactive world where they can generate characters, build branching plots, and bring fictional worlds to life with the help of a generative AI model (powered by Google Gemini).

## Features

- **AI Co-Writing**: Collaborate in real time with a generative AI to develop narratives, dialogue, and ideas.
- **Character Generator**: Instantly create detailed characters with unique attributes, motivations, and arcs.
- **Branching Plot Builder**: Design and visualize nonlinear storylines and decision trees.
- **Worldbuilding Toolkit**: Flesh out settings, cultures, magic systems, and histories with AI support.
- **Narrative Interface**: Interact with the story as though writing inside a magical, living book.

## Design Philosophy

### Book Aesthetic  
Every screen is designed to evoke the feeling of writing inside an ancient tome. The UI is grounded in visual motifs like:

- Dark, mysterious backgrounds reminiscent of old libraries
- Parchment-like textures that emulate aged paper
- Serif typography inspired by classic printed texts

### Minimalist Colors  
The interface relies on a black-and-white palette to create a timeless, engraved look, keeping the focus on the story itself.

### Immersive Animations  
Subtle animations and effects enhance the magical storytelling experience:

- Page-like transitions between views
- Glowing ink effects and AI typing animations
- Smooth chapter-based navigation

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API
- **Styling**: CSS, custom fonts, textured visuals
- **Animations**: CSS-based transitions
